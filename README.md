# Self-Organizing-Maps
A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction. The demo I made here shows how powerfull SOMs are. I used the Credit Approval Data Set from the UCI Machine learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval). 

The dataset includes 16 columns: the first one is the customer ID and the last one the class (approved, non approve). The total number of observation is 690.
